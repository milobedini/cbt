# User Flow

## Onboarding

- Opens app for the first time.
  - Brief welcome slider of the benefits of the app.
  - Ends on screen where the user says if they are a therapist or a client.
  - Register and login flow

## After Creating Account

- For therapists
  - Can login but account will not be activated until we (or later on anyone with admin privileges) permit them to be a therapist with us. They will just see a message explaining we are awaiting admin privileges etc.
  - Once activated they arrive into the main therapist side of the app.
- For patients
  - Accounts are always validated after signing up. Stuff like the note-taking feature, or other modules not marked as "accessRequired" will be available to all.
  - Each patient can have one therapist assigned to them. This is done by the therapist adding the user email in the therapist side of the app.
  - Once assigned a therapist, you will have a your modules/homework tab, and maybe a messaging tab for the relationship, and whatever else we want.

## MVP Features

- Modules -> just Depression to start with
- TBC...
